By Victor Kichwen and James Kimani
## Description
This application is an electronics store app where users can browse through various electronic products available in our store. Users can interact with the app to view available items, search for specific products, add new items to the store's inventory, and mark products as "out of stock" when they're no longer available.

## Setup
To get the application up and running, follow these steps:

//Clone the Git Repository

//Navigate to the Project Directory

//Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the repository has been cloned. 

//Install Dependencies

//Install the necessary packages :

## Core Deliverables
The user can:

1.View All Products on App Load
When the app starts, users can see a list of all available electronic products in the store, including product name, price, and availability.

2.Add New Product to Inventory
Users can add a new electronic item to the store by submitting a product form, including details like the product name, description, price, and stock status.

3.Add Product to Cart
Users can add any product to their shopping cart by clicking an "Add to Cart" button next to the product. This allows users to keep track of the items they wish to purchase.

4.Remove Product from Cart
Users can remove products from their shopping cart by clicking a "Remove from Cart" button. This updates the cart in real time, ensuring users can modify their selections before checking out.
